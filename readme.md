## GifEncoder.cpp
This file holds everything necessary to output an animated gif file. I wrote it so my custom game engine could, in engine, record and save gif animations. This is a good example of my low level programming knowledge. This file features a lot of fidly bit manipulation, packing and masking.

## CalculateSpline_Unity.cs
This file was written for a client. The client needed a system to create splines and spline followers. The spline follower would move along the spline in varying ways during gameplay. This script calculates the points for the spline. It features linear distance spline points, so the follower will move along the spline at a constant speed regardless of the shape of the spline. This is good example of my mathematical abilities.
